### User accept 

```SQL
WITH sentReq AS( 
    select *
    from fb_friend_requests
    where action = 'sent'
    ),
accpReq AS( 
    select *
    from fb_friend_requests
    where action = 'accepted'
    )
 
SELECT s.date, count(a.user_id_receiver)/count(s.user_id_sender)
FROM  sentReq s
left join accpReq a on s.user_id_sender = a.user_id_sender and a.user_id_receiver = s.user_id_receiver
group by date;
```
Notes: Depends how you join the tables. For example, if I was to choose accept request first than the join will change to right.
